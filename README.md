# utils

This repository contains some handy command line utilities that aren't included in the
GNU coreutils. They follow the same UNIX philosophy.

A lot of the tools here already exist in other languages/packages. The purpose of this
project project is more for fun/learning than it is for actual innovation/utility.

## Commands

### ts
Append a timestamp to each line in STDIN
